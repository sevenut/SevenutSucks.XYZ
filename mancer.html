<p style="color:#ffffff;">Mancer is work in progress card game! I don't actually have a title for it yet, but I've been calling it Mancer. I don't really like the name, but I need one, so whatever.</p>

<p style="color:#ffffff;">I'll update this page as development continues, but here's some creature images and descriptions to tide you over!</p>

    <td><center>The arboran is a manifestation of pure growth mana. They live in forests, always in constant search of new experiences. They have a rather cold and bleak outlook on life.</center></td>
    <td><center>The pisceran is a manifestation of pure flow mana. They live in the oceans, drifting from one place to another. They have no particular goal in mind, they simply exist as they are.</center></td>
    <td><center>The gaean is a manifestation of pure heat mana. They live in the mountains, where they live in solidly structured societies. They tend not to value individualism, opting for complete devotion to their society.</center></td>

<p>Ain't that interesting? Well, there are more creatures to come, so stay tuned for that! Now, how about some characters?</p>

    <td><center>The Lady in Purple is an ancient arboran who lives a reclusive life. She has boundless knowledge of the natural world and the arcane. People search her out so they might obtain even a little of her knowledge, but she doesn't share her knowledge with most people.</center></td>
